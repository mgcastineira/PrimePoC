One of the measures to support this ambition is to disable the possibility to write data to an external device using an USB port.For Accenture images USB writing is already disabled for some time based on internal security policies.And this message is to inform you that per 9 September 2019 the same will apply for Accenture devices running an Airbus image.Airbus security welcomed our request to implement this measure positively which underwrites the mutual responsibility we have to protect Airbus data.",
